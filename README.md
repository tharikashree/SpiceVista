#SpiceVista
"SpiceVista: Table Reservations Interface" is a mini project that focuses on creating an 
intuitive and visually appealing reservation system using only HTML and CSS for SpiceVista 
restaurant. This project aims to provide a seamless booking experience for customers while 
maintaining a minimalist approach to web development. Participants will explore HTML for 
structuring the reservation form and CSS for styling elements such as layout, typography, and 
form design. 
SpiceVista's reservation interface will prioritize user-friendly navigation, clear instructions, 
and responsive design to ensure accessibility across various devices. By immersing 
themselves in this project, participants will gain hands-on experience in front-end web 
development and user interface design, honing their skills in HTML and CSS to create elegant 
and functional web applications for restaurant reservations. The main objective is to build a 
web based restaurant management system for “SpiceVista” Restaurant.
